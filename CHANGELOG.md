[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-26

The first public release.

### Added

- Session line in a small always-on-top bar: turns, steps, and average streaming
  tok/s, where the average is generated tokens divided by active stream time so
  tool executions stay out of the denominator.
- Bar interaction: drag anywhere with a remembered position, a close button that
  collapses the bar to a square, and the square restores it.
- Follows the Desktop tab you are looking at, read from the app's own
  `tabs.recent` row (read-only, WAL aware), falling back to the session of your
  latest prompt and then to the last measured session.
- Leaves when the OpenCode app is closed, decided from the OS process list
  (`/proc`, `pgrep`, `tasklist`), and never hides the bar when a check cannot
  run.
- `selftest` command that reports whether the bar can run on this machine, with
  every line a measured fact.
- Announce a new version once, in place of the metrics, with no network call: the
  plugin compares its own `package.json` version against the one it recorded.
- Window lifetime hygiene: stale response markers are swept on a timer instead of
  waiting for the next message.

### Measured, not assumed

- 103 plugin checks and 44 bar checks run on every publish; the test suites keep
  their own status directory and never touch the one belonging to the person
  running them.
- The bar is verified on Linux with GNOME/Mutter on X11. The macOS and Windows
  paths are ordinary platform code with a fail-open rule, and their decision
  logic is covered by tests driven by a fake process list, but no macOS or
  Windows machine has run it yet.
